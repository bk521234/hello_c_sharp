hello world repo - beginning c# coding

## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to practice the building blocks of C#

## Observations
C# building blocks largely overlap with other programming languages so it is fairly easy to pick up.

## Quotes of wisdom
Brian Kernighan:
> Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.


Edsger W. Dijkstra:
> Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.
